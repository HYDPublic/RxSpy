# RxSpy

Debugging Reactive applications can be hardâ„¢. Chaining and joining observables right and left often produce an observable graph that can be hard to comprehend.

RxSpy tries to solve or at least alleviate this problem by giving developers a live birds-eye view of the applications, all observables within it and the signals they produce. By referencing a small library your app you can launch a reactive debugging session of sorts which gives you a visual interface through which you can see all observables in your app, the values they produced and where they where created from.

RxSpy consists of two pieces. ```RxSpy.Server``` which is the small library you include in your app and the visual tool RxSpy. ```RxSpy.Server``` initiates a small server inside of your app which the visual tool can then connect to. Through that connection ```RxSpy.Server``` then streams all observable events that it can possibly get its hands on.

## Running it

 - Include ```RxSpy.Server``` in your app and call ```RxSpySession.Launch``` at the entry point of your application. This call will block until the UI has had a chance to launch and connect.
 - If you're not running it through the solution you'll have to edit the ```RxSpySession.FindGuiPath``` and point it to the ```RxSpy.exe```. It's on my list

## Things currently trackable

 - All observables created through one of the standard Rx operators.
   - The class and method from which the operator was created and (if available) the file name and line.   
 - Signals (values) produced by observables
   - The timestamp of when the signal was produced
   - A string representation of the value itself (using ```DebuggerDisplay``` if available, falls back to ```.ToString()```)
   - What thread the value was produced on (helpful for debugging UI thread issues)
 - If the observable completed in error and (soon) the full details of that error
 - Total number of observables observed (no pun intended)
 - Total number of signals so far in the app
 - Signals per second currently

## Nifty things

 - By double-clicking on an observable in the app you get a visual graph rendering of that observable, all of its ancestors and descendants. The graph is live-updating and 
 - If you tack on ```.SpyTag("Foo")``` to one of the observables in your app that tag will show in the UI. Making it easy to locate the observable in the app.

## Planned

 - Support for connectable observables
 - Support for some of the more non-standard operators like ```Chunkify``` (which blocks and returns an IEnumerable)
 - Support arguments of ```IObservable<IObservable<T>>``` (Concat)
 - Capture more details around selectors
   - Observable.Timer should capture the arguments and the UI should show something like ```Timer (Immediate, 1s)``` instead of just ```Timer```.   
 - I would like to make it possible for libraries like ReactiveUI to signal that a series of observables should be grouped together. The ```WhenAny``` method in ReactiveUI for example should be considered an operator and should show up as a single node instead of the graph of observables stringed together to create it.
   - My current plan for this is to use  the ```System.ComponentModel.CategoryAttribute``` so that libraries don't have to take a dependency on RxSpy. ```WhenAny``` would then be decorated with ```[Category("RxSpy.Operator")]``` or something to that effect.
 - Breakpoints
   - It should be possible to select a node and trigger a breakpoint in the app when it produces a value, completes or signals an error. 
 - ```RxSpy.Server``` currently has a dependency on ```Microsoft.Tpl.DataFlow```, that's gonna go away once I get time to rewrite the pub/sub stuff without using Rx (ugh).
